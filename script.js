// Step 1
// In this workshop, you will continue to practice working with the 
// DOM and event handling by building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

// The HTML and CSS boilerplate for the game has been provided for 
// you.

// On the screen, you will see the rules to the game, the player 
// and computer scores and the buttons for the user to select Rock, 
// Paper, or Scissors.

// Your task over the next few steps is to build the JavaScript 
// functionality that generates a computer choice, compares it to 
// the player's choice, and updates the scores accordingly.

// Take some time to look through the HTML provided and familiarize 
// yourself with the structure of the game.

// When you're ready, click on the "Check your code" button to 
// proceed to the next step and start the workshop.
